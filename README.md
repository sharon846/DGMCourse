# DGM Course
Here you will find a task I have delveloped as being teacher assistant in DGM course.

## Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
The goal of this exercise is to understand and implement the DDPM model, as presented in class.
The students need to partially implement a UNET architecture and DDPM.

Some nice applications, beyond denoising, are:
- Given partial image, complete the content of the missing one.
- Using CLIP on CelebA dataset to guide the model towards our guidance.
